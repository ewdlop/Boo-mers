Here's a list of common communication and network protocols, along with a "secure" version by prefixing an "s" to denote a secure variation (where applicable):

### Protocols and Secure Versions
1. **HTTP** → **sHTTP** (Secure HTTP, though HTTPS is the standard for secure web communication)
2. **FTP** → **sFTP** (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
3. **SMTP** → **sSMTP** (Secure Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
4. **IMAP** → **sIMAP** (Secure Internet Message Access Protocol)
5. **POP3** → **sPOP3** (Secure Post Office Protocol)
6. **DNS** → **sDNS** (DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS are secure variations)
7. **Telnet** → **sTelnet** (SSH is the secure alternative)
8. **LDAP** → **sLDAP** (Secure Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
9. **SNMP** → **sSNMP** (Secure Simple Network Management Protocol via SNMPv3)
10. **SIP** → **sSIP** (Secure Session Initiation Protocol)
11. **RTP** → **sRTP** (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol)
12. **NTP** → **sNTP** (Secure Network Time Protocol)
13. **TFTP** → **sTFTP** (Secure Trivial File Transfer Protocol, though less common)
14. **MQTT** → **sMQTT** (Secure MQTT with TLS)
15. **XMPP** → **sXMPP** (Secure Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)
16. **SMB** → **sSMB** (Secure Server Message Block with SMB 3.0+)
17. **ICMP** → **sICMP** (Not typically securable; protection via firewalls and policies is preferred)
18. **ARP** → **sARP** (Secure ARP via cryptographic measures)

### Notes:
1. Prefixing an "s" does not imply the protocol inherently becomes secure—it often means implementing an existing secure standard or adding encryption layers (e.g., TLS, HTTPS, or other cryptographic techniques).
2. Some protocols, like ICMP or ARP, don’t have direct secure counterparts but can be safeguarded using network policies or other secure mechanisms.
3. Modern secure protocols rely heavily on **TLS** (Transport Layer Security) as their foundation for encryption and authentication.
