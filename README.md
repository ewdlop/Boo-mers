Here's a list of common communication and network protocols, along with a "secure" version by prefixing an "s" to denote a secure variation (where applicable):

### Protocols and Secure Versions
1. **HTTP** → **sHTTP** (Secure HTTP, though HTTPS is the standard for secure web communication)
2. **FTP** → **sFTP** (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
3. **SMTP** → **sSMTP** (Secure Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
4. **IMAP** → **sIMAP** (Secure Internet Message Access Protocol)
5. **POP3** → **sPOP3** (Secure Post Office Protocol)
6. **DNS** → **sDNS** (DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS are secure variations)
7. **Telnet** → **sTelnet** (SSH is the secure alternative)
8. **LDAP** → **sLDAP** (Secure Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
9. **SNMP** → **sSNMP** (Secure Simple Network Management Protocol via SNMPv3)
10. **SIP** → **sSIP** (Secure Session Initiation Protocol)
11. **RTP** → **sRTP** (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol)
12. **NTP** → **sNTP** (Secure Network Time Protocol)
13. **TFTP** → **sTFTP** (Secure Trivial File Transfer Protocol, though less common)
14. **MQTT** → **sMQTT** (Secure MQTT with TLS)
15. **XMPP** → **sXMPP** (Secure Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)
16. **SMB** → **sSMB** (Secure Server Message Block with SMB 3.0+)
17. **ICMP** → **sICMP** (Not typically securable; protection via firewalls and policies is preferred)
18. **ARP** → **sARP** (Secure ARP via cryptographic measures)

### Notes:
1. Prefixing an "s" does not imply the protocol inherently becomes secure—it often means implementing an existing secure standard or adding encryption layers (e.g., TLS, HTTPS, or other cryptographic techniques).
2. Some protocols, like ICMP or ARP, don’t have direct secure counterparts but can be safeguarded using network policies or other secure mechanisms.
3. Modern secure protocols rely heavily on **TLS** (Transport Layer Security) as their foundation for encryption and authentication.



Here is a detailed breakdown of network protocols for all seven OSI layers, along with secure versions (either existing or hypothetical, indicated by adding an "s" prefix):

---

### **1. Physical Layer**
The Physical Layer deals with hardware transmission, so there aren't protocols that can be "secured" directly.

- **Example Protocols**: Ethernet (PHY specifications), Bluetooth
- **Secure Version**: No direct secure equivalent; rely on higher-layer encryption (e.g., WPA3 for wireless).

---

### **2. Data Link Layer**
Handles data transfer between adjacent nodes with error detection and sometimes correction.

- **Protocols**:
  - Ethernet → **sEthernet** (802.1X for port-based Network Access Control)
  - Wi-Fi (802.11) → **sWi-Fi** (802.11i/WPA3 for encrypted wireless communication)
  - PPP → **sPPP** (PPP with CHAP for secure authentication)

---

### **3. Network Layer**
Responsible for routing, addressing, and packet forwarding.

- **Protocols**:
  - IP → **sIP** (IPsec for encrypted IP communication)
  - ICMP → **sICMP** (Mitigation of ICMP vulnerabilities using firewalls or secure wrappers)
  - ARP → **sARP** (Secure ARP, e.g., cryptographic ARP or ARP spoofing protection)
  - OSPF → **sOSPF** (OSPF with cryptographic authentication)

---

### **4. Transport Layer**
Handles end-to-end communication, error recovery, and data flow control.

- **Protocols**:
  - TCP → **sTCP** (TCP with TLS)
  - UDP → **sUDP** (DTLS: Datagram Transport Layer Security for secure UDP)
  - SCTP → **sSCTP** (SCTP with DTLS for secure stream communication)

---

### **5. Session Layer**
Manages sessions, maintaining connections and authentication.

- **Protocols**:
  - RPC → **sRPC** (RPC with TLS or GSS-API for secure remote procedure calls)
  - SMB → **sSMB** (SMB3 with encryption)

---

### **6. Presentation Layer**
Responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression.

- **Protocols**:
  - TLS/SSL → **sTLS/SSL** (TLS is already secure)
  - MIME → **sMIME** (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions for encrypted email)

---

### **7. Application Layer**
End-user protocols for accessing network services.

- **Protocols**:
  - HTTP → **sHTTP** or **HTTPS** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
  - FTP → **sFTP** (Secure File Transfer Protocol)
  - SMTP → **sSMTP** (SMTP over TLS)
  - IMAP → **sIMAP** (IMAP over TLS)
  - DNS → **sDNS** (DNS over HTTPS/TLS)
  - SNMP → **sSNMP** (SNMPv3 with encryption)
  - XMPP → **sXMPP** (XMPP over TLS)
  - SIP → **sSIP** (SIP over TLS)

---

### Summary Table of Secure Versions:

| **OSI Layer**    | **Protocol**          | **Secure Version**                |
|-------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| **1. Physical**  | Ethernet, Bluetooth   | Higher-layer encryption (e.g., WPA3) |
| **2. Data Link** | Ethernet, Wi-Fi       | sEthernet (802.1X), sWi-Fi (WPA3) |
| **3. Network**   | IP, ARP, OSPF         | sIP (IPsec), sARP, sOSPF          |
| **4. Transport** | TCP, UDP, SCTP        | sTCP (TLS), sUDP (DTLS), sSCTP    |
| **5. Session**   | RPC, SMB              | sRPC, sSMB (SMB3)                 |
| **6. Presentation** | TLS, MIME          | sTLS (already secure), sMIME      |
| **7. Application** | HTTP, FTP, SMTP     | HTTPS, sFTP, sSMTP, etc.          |

By integrating encryption mechanisms and cryptographic standards like **TLS**, most protocols can be secured at their respective layers.
